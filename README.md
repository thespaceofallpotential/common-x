# common-x: *knowledge culture*

> *yeh-yeh, **finding** solutions (in problem-spaces) is cool... --but did you ever think about **growing** them?!*

## overview

This repository ~~describes~~ *will eventually describe*:-

1. a generalised approach & method for solving *"common-x"* type problems -- *(like "common-substring" and "common-subsequence")*

2. detail on approach & algorithmic extensibility *(& transformation)*, to handle different kinds of *"common-x"* problems

3. an account of the ways in which all "*problem-space problems*" are reformulable in terms of *"common-x"*; and a discussion on the approach and significance of reformulating problems to *"well-formed commmon-x"*

4. a discussion on the *"ideal form"* of common-x solutions, including data-structures & hardware

## introduction
> *common-x: knowledge-culture*

So, it turns out that we can reformulate some *"finding things, in spaces"* type-problems, to *"growing things, in spaces"* type-problems *(--which is interesting, right?!)*

> for intuition, think of the difference bewteen recall and derivation -- *(the difference between being told something to remember (like LLMs, say); and independently working things out from "first-principles")*

Like independent derivation, we can grow solutions *(to a problem-space type problems)* piece-by-piece, from first-principles, to final structural form; and all without knowing specifically about the special-domain structural-forms *(which are grown)* in advance...

> for intuition, think of intellectual/cognitive creativity & insight -- *the gensis of new domains of knowledge*

More than the difference between recall & derivation, perhaps the most apt analogy for this kind of *"remarkably organic"* problem-solving, is biological-growth: specifically, when we want to artificially engineer *(only very simple)* biological-form, we must first isolate and prepare a special environment, free from pollutants, full of all of the rright kinds of principle *(chemical & biological)* *"pieces"* from which the intended forms will grow; and this is exactly what must be done to *"grow solutions to problem-space problems"* we must first identify and isolate only the right kinds of *"pieces"* from which the final solution form will grow...

...like a petri-dish in a laboratory environment...

...but within the entirely abstract domain of *"information"*

Knowledge, it seems, is like a crop; and must be cultivated

Learning, it seems, depends upon situationally/topically appropriate *"knowledge culture"*, from which structural representational forms are cultivated, and grown to maturity.

Wild.

Wild knowledge, in abstract realms...
