# common-x: *—from "knowledge culture" and a "universal solver"; to a basic model of "organic general-intelligence"*

Yeah-yeah, ***finding*** solutions (within some problem-space) is cool... *—but did you ever think about **growing** them?*

-  **knowledge culture**:  *~~finding~~ **growing** solutions within (cultivated) problem-space*

- **universal solver**:  *symmetry based problem-reformulation makes respective solutions "more accessible" ([notes](./notes/universal%20solver.md))*

- **organic general-intelligence**:  *against brute-force; domain invariant intelligence, from first-principles*

## overview

This repository ~~describes~~ *will eventually describe*:-

1. an [introduction](#introduction) to the premise of *"knowledge culture"*, to build intuition

2. a generalised approach & method for solving *"common-x"* type problems — *(like "common-substring" and "common-subsequence")*

3. detail on approach & algorithmic extensibility *(& transformation)*, to handle different kinds of *"common-x"* problems

4. an account of the ways in which all "*problem-space problems*" are reformulable in terms of *"common-x"*; and a discussion on the approach and significance of reformulating problems to *"well-formed common-x"*

5. a discussion on the *"ideal form"* of *"common-x solvers"*, including data-structures & hardware

## introduction
> *common-x: knowledge-culture; to understand (any) complexity, we must first understand it's simplicities, and how the two relate*

So, it turns out that we can reformulate some *"finding things, in spaces"* type-problems, to *"growing things, in spaces"* type-problems

*—which is interesting, right?*

> for intuition, think of the difference between recall and derivation — *(the difference between being told something to remember, like LLMs, say; and independently working things out from "first-principles")*

Like independent derivation, we can grow solutions *(to problem-space type problems)* piece-by-piece: from first-principles, to final structural form; and all without being told what to look for — without knowing in advance the *"special-domain structural forms" (which are subsequently grown)*

> for intuition, think of intellectual/cognitive creativity & insight — *the genesis of new domains of knowledge*

More than the difference between recall & derivation, perhaps the most apt analogy for this kind of *"remarkably organic"* problem-solving, is biological-growth.

Specifically, when we want to artificially engineer *(only very simple)* biological-form, we must first isolate and prepare a special environment, free from pollutants, full of all of the *"right kinds"* of ingredients, the *(chemical & biological)* *"pieces"* from which the intended forms will grow. And this is exactly what must be done to *"**grow** solutions, to problem-space problems"* we must first identify and isolate only the right kinds of *"ingredients"* from which the form of the final solution will grow...

...like a petri-dish in a laboratory environment...

...but within the entirely abstract domain of *"information"*...

Knowledge, it seems, is like a crop; and must be cultivated.

Learning, it seems, depends upon situationally appropriate *"knowledge culture"*, from which "structural representational forms" are cultivated, and grown to maturity. And just like physical-crops — *(in reality)* — it is sometimes quicker and easier to cultivate and grow a crop, than to find the same volume, arbitrarily distributed throughout some terrain...

Wild, *right?*

> *musing: consider that, with the [Cultivated Solver](./src/runners/cultivatedRunner.ts), might we be looking at **the domestication of "wild-knowledge"**, as a physical biological artefact, cultivated and grown (farmed?!), within abstract realms... ([notes](./notes/cultivated%20solver.md))*
