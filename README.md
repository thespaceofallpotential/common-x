# common-x: *knowledge culture*

> *yeh-yeh, **finding** solutions (in problem-spaces) is cool... --but did you ever think about **growing** them?!*

## overview

This repository ~~describes~~ *will eventually describe*:-

1. a generalised approach & method for solving *"common-x"* type problems -- *(like "common-substring" and "common-subsequence")*

2. detail on approach & algorithmic extensibility *(& transformation)*, to handle different kinds of *"common-x"* problems

3. an account of the ways in which all "*problem-space problems*" are reformulable in terms of *"common-x"*; and a discussion on the approach and significance of reformulating problems to *"well-formed commmon-x"*

4. a discussion on the *"ideal form"* of common-x solutions, including data-structures & hardware
