# notes: universal solver
> *commonality <-> symmetry <-> accessibility*

Where the *"common-x class of problems"* asks us to find symmetry between two reference-frames, the *"common-x class of solvers"* is also based upon symmetry, albeit far more generally — in nature, ~~nothing~~ no symmetry exists alone — common-x solvers represent symmetries between all types and kinds of problems; but also the nature, growth and evolution, of all universal form and complexity.

> There are many kinds of *"common-x"* problem *(like "common-substring" & "common-subsequence", plus all variants thereof)* — and even more kinds of the broader category of *"problem-space"* type problems *(which includes all problems which satisfy the characteristic-constraints of "NP-complete")* — and typically, each of these problems is considered and framed more by their *"unique characteristics"* *(what distinguishes them from the others)*, than their *"common characteristics"* *(the ways in which they are all the same)*.
> 
> The former *(a focus on unique characteristics)*, in the absence of the latter *(a focus on common characteristics)*, is a kind of *"premature optimisation"*: whereby attention inevitably descends into the intricacies of the ways in which *"unique characteristics"* *(of each problem, when considered in isolation)* are best represented and operated-upon by/ within *"the substrate of computation"* *(computational primitives, operators, language-specific implementations, etc...)* — which is to say *"premature optimisation"*, being a matter of committing to the *"problem as framed"*, rather than first considering more fundamental reformulation of the problem, to first minimise scope & scale of the problem, and with it the nature of *"what must be done"*, as opposed to *"what might..."*. #rewrite
