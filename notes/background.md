# background

Most problems can be formulated in terms of an abstract *"problem-space"*, within which the problem's respective solution might/must be found [^lso].

> we'll sometimes refer to these as *(set-theoretic) "subset problems"*, in that the solution is a subset of a problem set

The solution to some *"problem-space problems"* are formulable in terms of the *(set-theoretic)* intersection $\cap$ , between two or more abstract reference-frames.

> we'll sometimes refer to these as *(set-theoretic) "intersection problems"*, in that the solution subset corresponds with the intersect between two problem sets

In plan terms: the intersection between two reference-frames contains whatever is common between them, so in this way, *"intersection problems"* are *"common-x problems"*

The interesting thing about *"intersection/ common-x problems"*, is that, where the solution for a *"subset problem"* must be defined *(explicitly or implicitly)* in advance or externally, for *"intersection/ common-x problems"*, the solution is undefined until found.

Often the discussion of the evolution of cognition is waylaid by a dependency on pre-determined solutions, which cognition must then solve — but a far simpler, far more humble origin to our own cognitive circumstances, is that attention *(to the definition and subsequent exploration of solutions)* must result naturally in some way, which, *(i think uncontroversially and inescapably)*, aligns with the structural and operational mechanics of *"intersection/ common-x problems"* *(described throughout this repository)*.

For intuition on this correspondence, see the image in the repository "the-pattern": specifically bottom right "metaphor" — which for the purposes of the intuition, is sufficiently analogous with analogy ;) )*
