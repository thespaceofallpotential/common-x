A *"symmetric index"* maps higher-dimensional form to *(index)* keys which represent respective *(indexed)* form *"literally"*.

In this way, a *"symmetric index"* *(or a map generally)* represents and exploits symmetries-of-form *(between arbitrarily-different phenomena/dimensional-spaces)*, to enable interrogation and navigation of higher-dimensions, albeit at the *(correspondingly lower)* cost of lower-dimensional key-space
  
> for example: *in physical reality, we use a map to learn about an area — (say, how to get somewhere) — without needing to physically move. And similarly, we can use (smaller) lower-dimensional abstract-spaces, to avoid the costs of (larger) higher-dimensional ones...*

Notes: the rebranding of *"inverted index"* 

The reason for *"rebranding inverted index"* as *"symmetric index"*, is due to symmetries between a *"document-level inverted index"*, and the way i was using a *"(set-theoretic) set"* — as a lower-dimensional space to qualitatively discern filter and navigate higher-dimensional spaces.

Specifically, as it turns out: symmetries between reference-frames are exploitable both by 
analysis and synthesis; and consequently, symmetry generally, became the clear and unambiguous *thematic-unit, and interpretive/ representational context*. But more will be said 
at a later stage...
