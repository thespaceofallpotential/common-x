Notes:

At first glance, relative to the typical concerns of algorithmic efficiency, and discussion on fundamental nature of evolved intelligence, the *"deductive resolver"* appears quite inefficient, due to repeatedly operating over the same space, as it iteratively eliminates redundant complexity.

This will be addressed and remedied completely at a later stage; but for now consider this:-

â€”is it more intelligent to
