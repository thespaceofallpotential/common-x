# problem-space
> *based on [example 1 data](/notes/example_1/data.md)*

For two input-strings $a,b$ of lengths $n,m$, set to axis $x,y$, respectively, the area of the corresponding two-dimensional problem-space is equal to $n \times m$

Given:-

$$n = |a| = 28$$

> figure 1. *Spatial representation of $a$*

...and...

$$m = |b| = 33$$

![](/images/example-1--b-empty.png)
> figure 2. *Spatial representation of $b$*

The cooresponding area of the *"problem-space"* of *"example 1"* — *(within-which all common words and substrings thereof, might/must be found)* — is...

$$n \times m = |a| * |b| = 28 \times 33 = 924$$
