# python

Due to it's general ubiquity, python initially appeared to be an ideal language for exploring and demonstrating arbitrary algorithmic methods; but the performance disparity between standard python string search & manipulation and that of the built-in c-libraries -- *(like "re", the regex tool)* -- make venturing away from *"pythonic"* ways impractical...

> *and of course: the fact that "phythonic ways" are even a thing, is down to the same reason -- any attempt to solve problems in python with anything other than it's "pythonic special ways" quickly becomes problematic; hence, "you must do it this way"...*

> *musing: i wonder about the lasting effect of such constraints on "conceptualisation" -- (with regard to broader problem-solving and algorithmic-exploration) -- within the kinds of communities for which python is the uncontested default...*
